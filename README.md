Music theory implemented in Python. Notes, scales and chords.

It is still in development so feel free to read the code, fork and make pull requests! They are very welcome!


How to use
==========

It is very simple, everything is coded in a object-oriented style, for example:

    $ python -i musthe.py
    >>> a = Note('A')  #Default A4
    >>> a
    Note("A4")
    >>> str(a)
    'A'



Suppose you want to create tension, so you want the perfect fifth or the minor seventh of that A, so you do:

    >>> fifth = Interval('P5')
    >>> seventh = Interval('m7')
    >>> a+fifth
    Note("E5")
    >>> str(a+fifth)
    'E'
    >>> str(a+seventh)
    'G'

Though it is important to see that the octaves of those notes are different:

    >>> a.octave
    4
    >>> (a+seventh).octave
    5

Now lets try scales:

    >>> Scale(Note('B'), 'major')
    [Note("B4"), Note("C#5"), Note("D#5"), Note("E5"), Note("F#5"), Note("G#5"), Note("A#5"), Note("B5")]

It returns a list of Note instances, but can also be printed for a clean output:

    >>> print Scale(Note('B'), 'major')
    B C# D# E F# G# A# B
    
Fair enough.

Now with let's see basic chord usage:

	>>> Chord(Note('A'),'M')
	Chord(Note('A'), 'M')
	>>> Chord(Note('A'),'M').notes
	[Note("A4"), Note("C#5"), Note("E5")]
	>>> Chord(Note('Bb'),'dim').notes
	[Note("Bb4"), Note("Db5"), Note("Fb5")]

Default chord type is 'M' (Major). Currently, only triads (major, minor, diminished, augmented) are supported.



If you have lilypond installed, you can make little melodies using this program, an example is given in 'lilypond_example.py'
